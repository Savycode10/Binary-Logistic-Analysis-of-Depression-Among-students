# Binary-Logistic-Analysis-of-Depression-Among-students

This research aimed to comprehensively explore the prevalence of depression among students at Yaba College of Technology, along with the associated factors and predictors. The study, conducted with a sample size of 384 participants, employed binary logistic analysis to uncover valuable insights into the mental health landscape of the student population.

The findings of this research underscore the significant prevalence of depression among the study participants. Approximately 41.4% of the respondents were classified as "Depressed," while 58.6% were categorized as "Normal." This emphasizes the pressing need for attention to mental health concerns within the student community, urging institutions to consider comprehensive support systems and interventions.

In terms of associated factors, the analysis focused on educational levels and living arrangements. Notably, ND2 students were found to be 0.377 times less likely to experience depression compared to ND1 students, although this difference did not reach statistical significance. On the other hand, HND1 and HND2 students exhibited noteworthy results. HND1 students were 0.424 times less likely to be depressed than ND1 students, and this decrease was statistically significant. Similarly, HND2 students were 0.400 times less likely to experience depression compared to ND1 students, and this decrease was also statistically significant.

The exploration of living arrangements revealed interesting patterns. While students living with parents exhibited a decreased likelihood of depression (0.465 times less likely), this finding did not achieve statistical significance. Similarly, students living off campus (0.448 times less likely) and on campus (0.427 times less likely) also showed decreased likelihoods of depression, but these differences were not statistically significant.
